# Biography
Shuai Shao is currently an Algorithm Engineer in Bytedance AI Lab. His research interests are in the field of **Object Detection**, **Multimodal Content Understanding** and **Building Large-Scale Dataset**, with particular interests in solving fundamental research problems and building real-world working systems.

Shuai was born in Changchun, China. He received a B.S. degree from [Jilin University](http://www.jlu.edu.cn/) in 2017. Immediately following, he joined Megvii Research, and was mentored by [Dr. Gang Yu](http://www.skicyyu.org/) and supervised by [Dr. Jian Sun](http://jiansun.org/). 

Shuai has participated in programming contests since high school. He won a gold medal as the 2rd place in 2013 ACM-ICPC Asia Regional Contest and won the 19th place in 2014 ACM-ICPC World Finals. Then he was the coach of ACM-ICPC Team of Jilin University until graduation.
